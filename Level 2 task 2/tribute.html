            <h3>Early career</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ABOUT</strong>
                    <p>The selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,
                        after one first class season.[70] The Indian selection committee had shown
                        interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year,
                        but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to
                        the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his
                        Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
                    <P>He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his
                        pads.
                        While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most
                        remarkable
                        were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to
                        control
                        without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen.</P>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Captaincy</strong>
                    <p>Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful.
                        When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations.
                        However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying
                        "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[110] which translates into:
                        "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".[111]
                        Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of
                        Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions

                <li>
                    <strong>Decline phase of career</strong>
                    <p>Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four
                        innings.[129]
                        He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost
                        the
                        series.[130] In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Sachin
                        scored
                        his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman's haul, in his 99th Test match</p>

                    <strong>2003 Cricket World Cup</strong>
                    <p>Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup,[133] helping India reach the
                        final.
                        While Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of
                        the Tournament
                        award.[134][135]
                        He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series
                        involving New Zealand and Australia.[136][137] As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted
                        centurion, Matthew Hayden in the tri-series final</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Return to form and breaking Brian Lara's record</strong>
                    <p> n the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury.[200]
                        However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form,
                        scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test[201] before making 88 in the first innings of the second
                        Test,
                        breaking the record for most Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000-run mark
                        when
                        he was on 61.[202][203] He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on
                        the day he achieved the record.[204] He made a fifty in the third Test[205] and 109 in the
                        fourth,
                        as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.[206]</p>

                    <strong>Retirement</strong>
                    <p>On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test
                        series
                        against West Indies in November.[295][296] At his request, the BCCI arranged that the two
                        matches be
                        played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell would happen at his home ground.[297][298] He
                        scored
                        74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete
                        16,000
                        runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli.[23][299]
                        The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark
                        his
                        retirement from the sport.[300][301] Various national and international figures from cricket,
                        politics,
                        Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long Salaam Sachin Conclave organised by
